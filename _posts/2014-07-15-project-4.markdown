description: This was a group project for the development of a game for the oculus quest 2. Our game was to smash as many clown heads as you could before the time ran out, the clown heads used my node graph generator and simple ai behaviours to move around, in this game you can throw a hammer and have it return to you, the hammers returning has its own avoidance and will dodge around boxes to return to your hand
