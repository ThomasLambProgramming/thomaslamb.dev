							<br>
							<p>During my advanced diploma of games development, we were placed into a team of three designers, three programmers and three artists that would act as though they were 
								contracted to only produce the assets to a given brief.
								<br>
								<br>
								Small note: I currently do not have images associated with the project but by the 15th of January one of the designers with a working Oculus Quest will be 
								recording gameplay to fill in this page.

								<br>
								Carnival Carnage is a vr arcade game in which the player must smash clown heads within a time limit with a hammer that can return to them.

								<br>
								<p class="listText">
									Working with Unity's OpenXr develop environment was a challenge that provided alot of learning for me and the team. The requirement to make everything into a prefab
									and to be very specific on what changes had to be made to the player controller allowed us to learn about the importance of communication and structuring git commits
									to be informative.
									<br>
									I learnt alot about learning itself through needing to fill in the blanks while reading documentation that isnt the most informative for troubleshooting.
									Getting to work on Vr was also alot of fun for testing as our game included destructables from throwing the hammer.

								<p class="listText">
									Due to the limited time that we were given to complete this project. The art team was considered to be contracters working to a set brief. This gave alot of learning
									opportunitites as we had to really design the game and mechanics to accommodate with the lack of changes that could be made to the art.
